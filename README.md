###Overview of Project

Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that we’ve already combed through, we’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals to see how her play compared to others.

##Analysis and Challenges:

We created two graphs to be able to help us understand the relations between launch date and funding goals.
- The first one was targeted for the Theater category. We created a line graph divided up by months for plot points to see if there was a correlation with the date and timing itself.
